You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
SELECT items were joining together, use the join-table with both foreign keys as a common denominator between the two joins.

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
input: SELECT users.Firstname, users.Lastname, businesses.name, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;
output:
Mandy|Kaling|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|mint
Bradford|Pitt|Lotus Yoga|alright
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|sucks
Steven|Wonder|Sushi World|basic
Mandy|Kaling|Lotus Yoga|not bad
Holly|Berry|Amir Towing|whatevs

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

input: SELECT users.Firstname, users.Lastname, businesses.name, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id WHERE businesses.name = "Sushi World";
output: Steven|Wonder|Sushi World|basic
