# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps:
  # [convert input into hash key]
  # set default quantity
  # print the list to the console [p grocery_list]
# output: [hash]


# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list (item name, and optional quantity)
# steps:
  # print hash
  # ask user if they would like to add any additional items to the list?
  # set default quantity
  # use a loop to allow addition of unknown amount of items
  # conditional statements to initialise or break loop
  # print hash - debugging
# output: [updated hash]

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: [updated hash]
# steps:
  # print hash
  # ask user if they would like to delete an item from the list
  # wrap above in a loop to allow deletion of unknown amount of items
  # conditional statement to initialise or break loop
  # print hash - debugging
# output: [trimmed hash]

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: [hash]
# steps:
  # print hash with default quantities
  # would you like to update the quantity of items on your list?
  # conditional statement to intialise or break loop
  # prompt user requesting value you would like to update?
  # request new quantity for that specific value
  # print hash - debugging
# output: [final hash]

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: [final hash]
# steps:
  # consider capitalising final result or any other asthetic modification
  # iterate through the hash to print item and quantity on separate lines
  # method that takes a hash or each.do
# output: list of individual items and their quantities line-by-line
