*What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?*

The user user knows what he/she is doing from the start.
Unix was not design to stop user's from doing stupid things like Mac/Windows. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you to do anything you tell it to.

*In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?*

A virtual private server is a virtual machine sold as a service much like digital oceans droplets.

Advantages are cost and ability to set up without any hardware. Much more easily created and configured than physical servers.

*Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?*

Bad for security. It is good practice to run applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks on a root level to prevent bugs and cyber attacks wiping out your entire system.
